                        My name is <b>Gr√©goire</b>, and I'm currently a
                        first-year MSc Pro student at EPITECH. Originally from a Business
                        Administration background at EM Lyon Business School, I began teaching myself to
                        code in 2022. Over the past few years, I've built a solid
                        foundation in web technologies, including HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript. Through consistent self-learning,
                        practical projects, and collaborative work, I've gained
                        hands-on experience that goes far beyond the basics. I build
                        user-friendly, efficient, and visually appealing
                        websites with a strong focus on usability and clean
                        design. I'm always looking to grow, whether by exploring
                        new technologies or improving existing skills. I take
                        pride in being both a reliable team player and a
                        self-sufficient developer, and I'm excited about the
                        challenges and opportunities ahead.
